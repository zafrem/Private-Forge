## The purpose behind the development

"I'm not actually a professional developer. But after working with various systems, I kept getting the itch to build my own little tools. They didn't start as big, formal projects—they just kind of evolved bit by bit. Since I didn't have a team of designers or engineers to lean on, I just did everything myself. That's how Desk-tools came to life."

## Overview

Desk-tools is a comprehensive suite of 53+ utilities built for "hybrid professionals"—developers, designers, planners, and marketers who need a fast, privacy-focused workspace.

Built with **Next.js 15** and **React 19**, it runs entirely in your browser. All data is stored locally using **IndexedDB** (via Dexie.js), ensuring your work stays private and never leaves your machine.

### Privacy & Local-First

- **Zero Server-Side Storage** — Your notes, tasks, and settings are stored only in your browser via IndexedDB.
- **Offline Capable** — Once loaded, all tools work without an internet connection (PWA with service worker).
- **Privacy by Design** — No tracking, no data collection, no account required.

### Multi-Language Support

Available in **English**, **Korean**, **Chinese (Simplified)**, and **Japanese** with automatic browser language detection.

## Key Features

### Productivity Apps

| App | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Kanban Board** | Drag-and-drop project management with flexible columns |
| **Notepad** | Persistent note-taking with markdown support and tagging |

| **Weekly Scheduler** | Time-slot-based weekly planner |

| **Bookmarks** | Grouped URL bookmarks with drag-and-drop ordering |

### AI Integration (Ollama)

Connect to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance for private LLM-powered assistance:
- Chat with local models directly in the workspace
- Multiple chat sessions with history
- No API keys needed — your data stays on your machine

### Instant Search

Find any tool instantly with Fuse.js fuzzy search across names, descriptions, tags, and categories.

### Data Portability

Export and import all your data (notes, tasks, bookmarks, etc.) as JSON from the top navigation bar.

### Adding a New Tool

1. Add an entry to `lib/tools-registry.ts` with a unique `id`, `category`, and `path`
2. Create `app/tools/[tool-id]/page.tsx` as a client component (`"use client"`)
3. Wrap content with `<ToolLayout title="..." description="...">`
4. Add helper functions to `lib/` if needed

```tsx
"use client";
import { ToolLayout } from "@/components/tool-layout";

export default function MyToolPage() {
  return (
    <ToolLayout title="Tool Name" description="Tool description">
      {/* Tool UI here */}
    </ToolLayout>
  );
}
```

## Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zafrem/Desk-tools.git
   cd Desk-tools
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview static build locally**:
   ```bash
   npx serve@latest out
   ```

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:ci       # CI mode with coverage (lcov + html)
```

Tests are located in the `__tests__/` directory and cover utility functions, components, and tool registry validation. Coverage reports are generated for SonarQube integration.

## Deployment

This project is configured for **GitHub Pages** with automatic deployment. Any push to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow which:

1. Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Builds the static export with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/Desk-tools`
3. Deploys the `/out` directory to GitHub Pages

## Feedback & Requests

I am committed to constantly evolving this platform. If you have a tool request or found a bug, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/zafrem/Desk-tools/issues).
